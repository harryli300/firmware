## KDH Design Inc. 

Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19. .
## Summary
KDH Design Inc., with  a brand JARVISH, is developing smart IoT devices. Our team has vast experience and skill with both the technical and practical aspects of the industry and the main strength is system integration. We have plans to build a Light Hotspot and will harness our experience to build a robust solution. 

## Company Information (required)
KDH Design Inc. is an innovative company established in 2014 with the vision to bring superior design, high-quality accessible  products to consumers around the world. To reach the real Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and the Internet of Things (IoT), we planned to start from helmets. The smart helmet with the brand, JARVISH, we built could keep riders in connection while driving.

JARVISH smart helmet  launched the first shipping in the market in 2017 and has saled thouhands of devices since these years. The second step we planned is to build up the connection between riders and motorbikes. Through the specific communication box which is designed like an OBD unit, riders could be informed about the vehicle's data, e.g. residual oil quantity, speed, and etc. More, with establishing the wireless connectivity like Wi-Fi, LoRa, or 5G on the communication box, we could connect motorbikes to achieve Intelligent Transport System (ITS).

We considers smart helmets to be pioneering product and platform that will define an era, as well as products closely linked to consumer’s daily lives. Much like smartphones, firstly they were only cool high-tech gadgets, but quickly became an essential part of everyone’s daily life. In the near future, smart safety helmets will definitely be as common as smart phones.
